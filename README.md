# Demos
Demos of code that I've created

There are 2 (poor) videos of code that I produced using python to control a selenium interface to complete gaming tasks to earn crypto currency. These were RPA tech test problems. This particular set of code also included a method to circumvent a particular jigsaw type of CAPTCHA

The JuliaSetOutput is a video that I put together to show the cycling through 360 degrees of input into a Julia set. This was a spurious solution that I was asked to put together to show that I understood what NFTs were. It was published on OpenSea.

Globe video was a tech test to create a 3D globe and display using Angular Framework, and then use some form of API to get details about a specific IP address.

I guess that I might get round to adding every 'tech test' that I've been given in the past as theres a few other 'interesting ones'!
